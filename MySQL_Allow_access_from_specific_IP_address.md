**Find file containing bind-address and set bind-address to address of Specific IP of server**
```
grep -r bind-address /etc/
Example:
/etc/mysql/mariadb.conf.d/50-server.cnf

# Edit file containing bind-address
vi /etc/mysql/mariadb.conf.d/50-server.cnf

Find the setting that says bind-address underneath the [mysqld] section. 
By default, this should currently be configured to the loopback address 127.0.0.1. 
Delete that address and put your serverâ€™s public IP address in its place. 
We will just use 199.27.180.192 for the sake of the example. 
[mysqld]
bind-address = 199.27.180.192

# restart mysql server
service mysql restart
```
