**Install PHPUnit**
```
Go to http://phpunit.de and check phpunit version compatible with your PHP version once you find the compatible version copy the composer command and go to root directory or directory containing application directory and run the command.

To verify if PHPUnit is installed successfully go to your root directory where vendor and application folders are and in command line type /vendor/bin/phpunit -version
It should return the phpunit version
```
